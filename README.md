THOUGHTS GOING INTO THIS HOMEWORK
My first attempt at using Node by myself. While working on this project, I intend to also work on becoming better at front end.

FINAL PRODUCT
I ran out of time trying to figure out how to do the "do-what-it-says" part down, and I couldn't get the I Saw The Sign part to work either. Still, everything else works great.

*Also, I didn't know how to insert or copy/paste a picture into the README
