# liri-node-app
My first attempt at using Node by myself. While working on this project, I intend to also work on becoming better at front end. While my team members disagreed, I still felt I dropped the ball on the design. If I'm going to get good enough and have made enough to get me a job after I graduate, then I won't let myself slack off anymore.
